# open-bidentate-explorer

A workflow for automated catalyst structure analysis. Uses Mace and ChemSpaX for 
bias-free catalyst structure generation. CREST is used for conformer search and Mofeus/Mordred
are used for descriptor calculation. Afterwards, the descriptors are boltzmann averaged and compared for 
predictive purposes.
